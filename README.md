# MIDI-MT-Translate

Do you want to contribute to support various languages for the MIDI-MT project, or add your native language to the project?
This is not difficult to do, further instructions will help you with this.

Go to the site [gitlocalize.com](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/8873), there you will see a list of active languages for translating the project.

- If your language is not listed, add it using the `Add language` button.
- Once you have selected the target language, navigate to the file you wish to translate.
- After you've finished translating the file, to submit your work, click the `Create Review Request` button, this will send your changes to the MIDI-MT project - repository. In the next release of the MIDI-MT release, you will be able to see your changes if they are accepted.

More detailed instructions for working with the gitlocalize.com site can be found [here](https://docs.gitlocalize.com/how_to_contribute.html).
